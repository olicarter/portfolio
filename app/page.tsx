          Oftentimes, when {dogName} or I have insomnia, I check the phase of
          the moon to see if there&apos;s any correlation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results vary, but one constant is how cluttered the sites for
          checking the moon phase are. Sometimes, you want oodles of science to
          pore through. However, when youâ€™re wide awake at 2 a.m., simplicity is
          your friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s why I made moonphased, a hyper-minimal UI for checking the
          moon phase in the dead of night.

          My attempts to animate gradients using CSS were awkward and
          disappointing; they never felt as interesting, fluid, or organic as I
          envisioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having been exposed to noise algorithms through the fantastic Three.js
          Journey course, and armed with the superpower that is Github CoPilot,
          I set out to create the perfect noise-based gradient animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results were exactly what I wantedt; always moving, merging,
          fading, glowing, sometimes dark, sometimes pastel, infinitely random,
          yet performant and tweakable.
